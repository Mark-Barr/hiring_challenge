================

This repository contains all of the information you should need to get started on our hiring challange.

# goal

The goal of this challenge to create two simple applications.  We're trying to make it so these don't take more than an hour or two, depending on you're experience and how far you're willing to take it.

# simple api application

The first of the two applications you should create is an api which serves the data found in the `data` folder in the repository.  We're purposely keeping the specification simple and open, giving you the ability to demonstrate how you think through a problem.

Ideally, you will create an api which can accessed by a remote application that provides access on a semi-atomic level to the synthetic population found within the data files.

For more information on the dataset, please look [here](https://www.epimodels.org/midas/Rpubsyntdata1.do).  In particular, this is the 2010 version 1 U.S. synthesized population of Arkansas.

# simple consumer application

The second application should consume the data provided by the other application, and doing something interesting with it.  It should save the data in some sort of permanant data store (like a SQL DB), and display something.  (We'll leave the something up to you, but it could be a simple web application that displays the data in a table, or a force directed graph relating various entities together.  Use your imagination!)

# need help?

# getting started

First, fork this repository.  Github has a lot of learning resources if you're not familiar with it; please take advantage of them if you don't already know how to do this.  Second, write the two applications, reaching out to me as necessary.  Third, answer the questions in the previous section by editing the readme.  Fourth, submit a pull request to this repository whenever you feel confortable with what you've created.

Remember, we're looking to find out how you work through a problem.  This doesn't have to be your magnum opus, or some sort of magical masterpiece.
